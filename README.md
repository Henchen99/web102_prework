## Notes

I am familiar with HTML and CSS from previous projects but not so much Javascript. However I do have a signficant 
amount of experience in programming (Python, C++) so the logic came quickly, plus the notes were well explained which helped!

Finally getting a better understanding of how Javascript is used alongside HTML and CSS was very eyeopening.

Unfortunately due to time constaints, I wasn't able to work on any of the optional tasks, although I hope to try them in the future.
